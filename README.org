* Building and running
** Requirements
- Python 3.6+
- ~pip~
- ~pipenv~
- Android SDK (Optional, only needed for building apk)
** Running on desktop
Dependencies are managed with pipenv. Therefore, you should be able to run the project as follows:
#+begin_src sh
  pipenv install
  pipenv run python main.py
#+end_src
** Building for Android
TBD.
- [[https://github.com/kivymd/KivyMD#how-to-use-with-buildozer][Documentation on deploying apk]]
** Building for IOS
Out of scope but should be possible.
- [[https://kivy.org/doc/stable/guide/packaging-ios.html][Documentation for building iOS packages]] (Packages should need specific versions, as this project uses KivyMD instead of regular Kivy)

* TODO Enhancements
- git flow
- CI/CD (building apk on master, linting on all branches)
